Measure what matters by John Doerr

Have up to 5 Key Results to measure yourself up to
Continuously review and iterate at a regular interval, every 1 month or every quarter

Setting OKRs should give you the power to
- focus and commit to priorities
- align teammates and beter connections for teamwork
- track and be held accountable for progress
- stretch and disrupt for innovative results

Commit to objectives that are 100% achievable but also commit to objectives that are a stretch with 40% achievability

Continuous performance reviews
1. conversation in 1-1 to align personal objectives to company objectives
2. feedback is a 2 way discussion on the report's output and what they need from the manager or company
3. recognition is very important to motivate and push people to achieve unexpected results

Do not mix compensation with goal they define since that causes people to be more cautious and less innovative
Instead performance should be the results they achieve working towards the ambitious goals; therefore performance is on a different scale for each person

Provide the objective and allocate people resources to reach the objective as they see fit
Hire smart people so they can come up with the solution; don't provide a solution for them to implement
